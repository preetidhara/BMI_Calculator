# BMI_Calculator  📱 📏 ✔️

This project consist on creating an Android App that calculates BMI ( Body Mass Index ) & then report its status with some advices to the user ...

In this project I tried to simplify all the process using the most simple formula & deviding the BMI state into just 3 categories...

BMI Formulat : bmi= weight (kg) / ( height^2 (m))

BMI Categories:

Low : bmi < 18.5
Normal : 18.4 < bmi < 25.1
High : bmi > 25
